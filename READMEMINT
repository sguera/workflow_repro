Refer to the paper: "Reproducible Experiments in Parallel Computing: Concepts and Stencil Compiler Benchmark Study" published in the Springer LNCS "Euro-Par 2014: Parallel Processing Workshops"

Required software (must be installed and in PATH):
wget
unzip
ghc
gmp

        -------------------------------

In order to run the workflow properly, please make sure to have installed the required dependencies, as stated in $WORKFLOW_HOME/manual/Manual.pdf

After having installed those dependencies you are able to run it as follows:

1) Place yourself in the $WORKFLOW_HOME
2)Install the workflow with the following command:
		./workflow.sh install all
	This will install all of the available methods for the wave problem.
3) Run the benchmarking with the following command:
		nohup ./workflow.sh run all
	The output of this, will be a png file with a graphical overview of the GFlops/s produced by each of the methods used for the wave stencil.
